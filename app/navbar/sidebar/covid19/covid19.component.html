            <b style="color: mediumblue;">=> </b> People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person to person 
            through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, 
            or speaks.These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground. People can catch
            COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with the virus.This is why it is important to 
            stay at least 1 meter) away from others. These droplets can land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables,
            doorknobs and handrails.
